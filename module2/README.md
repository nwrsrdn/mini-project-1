### Objective:
Trainees will build a foundational Express.js application interfacing with MongoDB. The application will simulate real-time data ingestion, have CRUD functionalities, and send notifications (email or SMS) when sensor data hits certain thresholds. Proper logging, data validation, and error handling will be integral parts of the project.

### Tasks:
1. **Project Setup and CRUD Operations**
   - Initialize a new Node.js project, setting up Express.js and MongoDB connectivity.
   - Define a Mongoose schema for sensor data (temperature, humidity, etc.).
   - Develop routes and controllers for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting sensor data.

2. **Automated Sensor Data Ingestion with Cron Jobs**
   - Use the `node-cron` package to simulate real-time sensor data generation.
   - Create a cron job that regularly (e.g., every 5 minutes) posts simulated data to your database, mimicking sensor input.

3. **Threshold-based Notifications**
   - Set up a notification system using an email (e.g., SendGrid) or SMS service (e.g., Twilio).
   - Implement logic to check if incoming sensor data (real or simulated) exceeds predefined thresholds.
   - Send notifications when certain sensor data points exceed specified thresholds (e.g > 40 degrees celcius), including information about which threshold was crossed and the current data. For

4. **Logging with Winston/Morgan**
   - Integrate Winston or Morgan for logging all requests to the application.
   - Configure the logger to capture detailed info in development (verbose mode) and essential information in production.

5. **Validation and Error Handling**
   - Utilize a validation library (e.g., `Joi` or `express-validator`) to enforce data integrity for API requests.
   - Implement a global error handler that captures and logs errors while returning user-friendly error messages.

6. **Environmental Variables**
   - Use the `dotenv` package to manage environmental variables.
   - Ensure sensitive information (database connections, threshold values, API keys for email/SMS notifications) are stored securely and are not hard-coded.

### Deliverables:
- Source code repository, preferable with commit history demonstrating incremental progress.
- A working Express application that accomplishes the tasks specified above.
- Proof of notifications via email or SMS.
- A well-documented README that includes:
  - Overview of the application.
  - Instructions for setting up and running the application.
  - Description of the API endpoints.

### Extension (Optional):
- Integrate a frontend dashboard (e.g., using React or EJS templating) that displays the sensor data being ingested in real-time.
