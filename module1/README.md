### Mini-Project: Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

#### Objective:

Develop a real-time monitoring dashboard that displays metrics data from a CSV file. The dashboard should update in real-time when the CSV file changes.

#### Key Learning Outcomes:

-   Understand and implement HTTP server and client using Node.js.
-   Implement real-time data transmission using WebSockets.
-   Handle file system operations, like reading files and watching file changes.
-   Understand and implement event-driven programming using events and `EventEmitter`.
-   Implement asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

#### Requirements:

##### Backend:


1.  HTTP Server:

    -   Create an HTTP server using the `http` module.
    -   Serve the CSV file via an HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/metrics`).
2.  WebSocket Server:

    -   Implement a WebSocket server to push real-time updates to the frontend.
    -   Use either the `http` module (for a challenge) or `socket.io` (for ease).
3.  File Watcher:

    -   Use the `fs` module to watch the `metrics.csv` file for changes.
    -   When the file changes, read the new content and send it to connected WebSocket clients.
    -   Optionally, use `chokidar` or similar package for more robust file-watching.
4.  Data Parsing and Transmission:

    -   Parse the CSV data and transmit it to the frontend in a suitable format (e.g., JSON).

##### Frontend (Optional):

You can use the included frontend dashboard to test your backend. Just go to the `dashboard` folder and adjust the `ENDPOINT` accordingly with your backend endpoint and run `npm start`.

1.  HTTP Client:

    -   Fetch the initial metrics data from the HTTP server using `fetch` API.
2.  WebSocket Client:

    -   Establish a WebSocket connection to the server to receive real-time updates.
    -   Update the UI in real-time when new data is received from the WebSocket server.
3.  UI Rendering:

    -   Display the metrics data in a table or other suitable format.
    -   Update the UI without reloading the page when new data is received.
4.  Error Handling:

    -   Gracefully handle any errors, such as failed HTTP requests or WebSocket connections.

#### Tasks:

1.  Setup:

    -   Set up the Node.js project and install any necessary dependencies.
    -   Create the initial `metrics.csv` file with some sample data.
2.  Backend Development:

    -   Implement the HTTP server and endpoint to serve the CSV file.
    -   Implement the WebSocket server to send real-time updates to the frontend.
    -   Implement the file watcher to detect changes in the CSV file and send updates.
3.  Frontend Development (Optional)

    -   Implement the UI to display the metrics data.
    -   Implement the HTTP client to fetch the initial data.
    -   Implement the WebSocket client to receive real-time updates and update the UI.
4.  Testing (Optional)

    -   Ensure that the HTTP server serves the CSV file correctly.
    -   Ensure that the WebSocket server sends updates when the CSV file changes.
    -   Ensure that the frontend displays the initial data and updates in real-time.
5.  Optimization (Optional):

    -   Optimize the backend and frontend for better performance and user experience.
    -   Implement additional features, such as data visualization using charts or graphs.

#### Additional Notes:

-   Explore and understand the documentation of Node.js modules and any third-party libraries.
-   Follow best practices for coding, such as consistent code styling, modularization, and commenting.
-   Sample source code resources are available during the workshop for understanding core concepts, such as asynchronous programming, event-driven programming, and WebSockets.

#### Evaluation Criteria:

-   Functionality: The application works as expected and fulfills the requirements.
-   Code Quality: The code is clean, organized, and follows best practices.
-   Error Handling: The application handles errors gracefully and provides a good user experience.
-   Additional Features: Any additional features or improvements implemented beyond the basic requirements.

#### Conclusion:

This mini-project aims to provide hands-on experience with core Node.js concepts and develop a practical application using fundamental and advanced features of Node.js. Trainees will gain valuable insights into real-time data transmission, asynchronous programming, and event-driven architecture.
